# Groundwater Modeling Class

***Warning this is not perfect and should be considered a work in progress***

I do not typically code in Python and this is my first attempt at developing a new set of labs for my groundwater flow modeling class at the University at Buffalo.  The original set of labs was based around MATLAB.  However, what I am finding is that students learn how to use MATLAB in graduate school but then canâ€™t afford it once they join the workforce or their company is not willing to put down the money.  As a result, my goal here is to develop an alternative set of tools for student that are open source.  

There will be errors in these files and likely 1000s of better ways to set up these notebooks.  I am always open to suggestions and will be happy to make modifications accordingly.  Please feel free to e-mail me or call me.
